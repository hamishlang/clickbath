### Overview

Click Bath is an ambient music generator. It allows the user to click on one of two pads to produce a calming tone. It can be used by musicians and non-musicians alike, no musical theory is required. 

__What's with the name?!?__
The idea is a play on ‘sound baths’, which is usually just ambient music played live on non traditional instruments which is rising in popularity. 



__Features Overview__

- Allows users to assign one of ten sounds to one of the two pads, the color of the pad will change depending on the tone selected when changed.

- Notes can be chosen from either a musical scale or a ‘mood’ based scale for non-musicians.

- 10 Presets available

- A weather specific preset can be loaded from the users location.

- Oscilloscopes that react to the sound being played. 

- Environmental soundscapes can be blended into the tones via the center knobs.

- Pads randomly generate notes based on the tone and key, and based on the users mouse location within the pad and play a high tone at the top, or a low tone at the bottom.

- Tones created by myself, using a combination of synths, guitars, and pre recorded sample libraries.

#### TECH USED 

- Tone.js for sound playback, musical control.

- WebAudio Controls for the Knob interaction controls.

- Nexus.js for Oscilloscope functionality.

- JQuery.

- OpenWeather API.




#### MAY 2021 UPDATES

- Removed Firebase due to not wanting user authentication. Added hard coded presets.

- Fixed Major and Minor notes scales. 

- Removed Panning due to the clicking that it was producing when it was changed and a note was still being played.

- Added 'About' section. Either click on the top left question mark or on the title to view further information. 

- Made mobile friendly (though performance is poor on it).

- Further refactoring, toned down the comments etc.
